# Datasets directly in S/BLOW5 format

1. The NA12878 R9.4.1 PromethION dataset sequenced for the [SLOW5 paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-01147-4):
 - Number of reads: 9,083,052
 - No. of Gbases: 93.4
 - SRA data access: [SRR22186402](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/?view=run_browser&acc=SRR22186402&display=data-access) 
 - direct download: [slow5.tar](https://slow5.page.link/na12878_prom_slow5)                         
 - MD5sum: 3b23f706add38612445cd4f5204ae8b5 

I have converted the following public datasets to BLOW5 format, but I do not have large enough storage to host those. These converted BLWO5 files are currently stored locally in a archive storage at Garvan Institute, if anyone is interested contact.

- All raw nanopre data from [Telomere-to-telomere consortium CHM13 project](https://github.com/marbl/CHM13)
- All [nanopore-wgs-consortium](https://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/NA12878) datasets (both DNA and RNA data)
- [SP1 SARS-CoV-2 dataset](https://community.artic.network/t/links-to-raw-fast5-fastq-data-for-artic-protocol/17)
- Some of the [Zymo Mock commuinity](https://github.com/LomanLab/mockcommunity) data
