\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the \textit{aims} of this paper  were to efficiently compress the SLOW5 file format to a size smaller than its FAST5 counterparts, maintain parallel access in the process and achieve the best possible level of performance within these constraints. Each was successfully accomplished and detailed hitherto.

Moreover, by exploiting space efficient compression techniques and multithreading, the space requirements of FAST5 files can be reduced by 20\% whilst performing read accesses 31 times as fast. The impact of these conclusions are far-reaching for the nanopore sequencing community and the future of bioinformatics.
