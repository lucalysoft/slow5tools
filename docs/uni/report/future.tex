\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

In addition to the steps for adoption into the research community detailed in section \ref{sec:disc:eval}, future work includes experimenting with different levels of compression and alternative algorithms used by the zlib library for the compressed binary encoding of the SLOW5 file format. Also, there is scope for additional encodings of the SLOW5 format to be designed and developed.
