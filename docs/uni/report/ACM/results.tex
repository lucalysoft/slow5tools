\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}


The results section should have the results of your experiments and
measurements. Evaluation is the most important part of the research. Sometime
you might want to split it into more than one section depending on the type of the project.



Again make sure you give enough details so that the reader can reproduce your
evaluation. Your GitHub code is not a replacement of the details, GitHub will
perish, your paper will remain in this world for centuries to come. Of course,
you need strike a balance between mundane details vs what makes your evaluation
unique.
