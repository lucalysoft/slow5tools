\section{Methodology/Design}
\label{sec:methodology}

Use this section describe the main contribution of your paper. If you are
building something, describe the design of the system you built. If you are
measuring something (like the world!) then include the measurement pipeline.

This is typically the largest section in your paper. (In case of measurement the
result section might be bigger.)


Make sure you give enough details so that the reader is able to reproduce your
work.
