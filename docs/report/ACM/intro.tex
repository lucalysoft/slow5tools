\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Introduction to your project. Start from some common knowledge that most of the
reader (in computer security) would have and then narrow down to the details of
your project. Speak about why the project is important, and why the reader
should care about it. Finally talk briefly about what are you have done (for
final project), what you are planning to do (for proposal). Reader should get a
good chunk of understanding about your project from this introduction section
(\secref{sec:intro}).
It's good to finish introduction section with a quick list of contributions. 


\subsection{For project proposal.}\label{sec:proposal}
The sections mentioned here is just for reference. You are free to change them
as you find suitable. In particular for proposal, some of the sections such
as~\secref{sec:eval} might not make much sense. You can skip that.
