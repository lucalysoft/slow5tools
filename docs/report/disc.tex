\section{Discussion}

When integrated with popular third part tools for nanopore sequencing analysis (e.g. Bonito, Nanopolish and F5C), it is anticipated that the SLOW5 format will deliver considerable performance advantages that will scale with the number of allocated threads. Given these advantages, the SLOW5 format should be readily adopted by the Nanopore sequencing community.

Different levels of compression and algorithms used by the zlib library for the compressed binary encoding are for future work.
